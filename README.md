## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyautogui.

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```
Next, we need the yelp datasets to make reviews. Go download *yelp_academic_dataset_business.json* and *yelp_academic_dataset_review.json* from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?resource=download)

*Make sure those two files are in the same folder as this repository*
## Usage
```python
python ./findrelevantReviews.py
```
